  pyan
===============================================================================

Modified pyan.py by Juha Jeronen, based on original pyan.py by Edmund Horner.

The modified version has some additional features for GraphViz output that can be useful for working with large projects.

New command-line options are available to:

- Color nodes automatically (-c). A HSL color model is used, picking the hue based on the top-level namespace (effectively, the module). The colors start out light, and then darken for each level of nesting. Seven different hues are available, cycled automatically.

- Group nodes in the same namespace (-g, -e). GraphViz clusters are used for this. The namespace name is used as the cluster label. Groups can be created as standalone (-g, always inside top-level graph) or nested (-e). The nested mode follows the namespace structure of the code.

- Disable generation of links for “defines” relationships (-n). This can make the resulting graph look much clearer, when there are a lot of “uses” relationships. This is especially useful for layout with “fdp”.

- Disable generation of links for “uses” relationships (-N). Can be useful for visualizing just where functions are defined.


Other changes:

The “defines” relations are now drawn with gray arrows, so that it’s easier to visually tell them apart from the “uses” relations when there are a lot of edges of both types in the graph. (The dotted line style is the same as in the original.)

Nodes are now always filled (white if color disabled), and made translucent to clearly show arrows passing underneath them. This is useful for large graphs with the fdp filter.

With the exception of the disable switches, which support both output formats, all modifications are for GraphViz output only.

  XDot
===============================================================================

This XDot was modified by Juha Jeronen, based on the original by José Fonseca.


Modifications:

- Added a "Find" feature for searching graph elements by the text they display. The search is always case-insensitive. By default the Find system runs in incremental mode; for viewing a large graph on a slow computer, there is a new "-N" command line option to use non-incremental mode.

- The hover-over-node highlight system has been extended to make exploring large graphs easier. See below.

- Keyboard shortcuts added for Zoom to fit (F) and Zoom to 100% (1).

- Keyboard shortcut added for Open (Ctrl+O).

- Tooltips added for the toolbar buttons, with the text showing also the keyboard shortcuts.

- The open dialog remembers the last used directory within the same session.

- Focus animation now follows a nonlinear tanh spacing for a smoother-looking
  experience (slow-fast-slow).

- Uses system highlight color, queried from GTK.

  For nodes, the actual node highlight color is mixed from the node's original color
  and alpha, and the system highlight with alpha=1.0.

  For area zooming (shift+drag), the system highlight color is used with alpha=0.25.

- [No graph loaded] is shown when no graph is loaded (input error, no filename on command line, etc.).

- [Empty input] is shown when an empty graph is loaded (blank file, or valid graph but no nodes).

- Minor UI fixes (e.g. mouse cursor now changes to busy while loading).


In addition, the original contains some functionality that may be difficult to discover. Documenting these, from reading the source code:

- Shift-dragging allows to select a rectangular area to zoom to.

- Ctrl-dragging zooms smoothly.

- Hovering the mouse cursor over a node highlights it.

- Hovering over the end of a link (graph edge, "arrow") highlights the node at the other end of the link. (This is useful for exploring graphs.)

- Clicking a highlighted node centers it. Animated. The animation automatically zooms out and back in, if the view is highly zoomed and the destination node is near the edge of the view. If the destination is clearly visible, then the animation just pans the view.

- Clicking the end of a highlighted link (graph edge, "arrow") jumps to and centers the node at the other end of the link. (Animated.)

Mouse behaviour and keyboard shortcuts
--------------------------------------

Here is a complete list for both the original and modified versions of XDot. Unless otherwise specified, each item applies to both versions.

-----
Mouse
-----

Click the end of a link    = Center view to the node at the other end of the link
Click a node               = Center view to clicked node

Hover on the end of a link = Highlight link and the node at the other end
Hover on a node            = Highlight node                              [original version]
                             Highlight node and all its outgoing links   [modified version]
Alt+hover on a node        = Highlight node and all its incoming links   [modified version only]
Shift+hover on a node      = Highlight node, all its outgoing links
                             and the nodes connected by the links        [modified version only]
Ctrl+hover on a node       = Highlight node, all its incoming links
                             and the nodes connected by the links        [modified version only]

Mouse wheel up/down        = Zoom view in/out
Drag                       = Pan view
Shift+drag                 = Zoom to area (choose the area while dragging)
Ctrl+drag                  = Zoom smoothly

Dragging accepts both left and middle buttons.

--------
Keyboard
--------

Arrow keys                 = Pan view
+, =, Page up, keypad +    = Zoom in
-, Page down, keypad -     = Zoom out
F                          = Zoom to fit            [modified version only]
1, keypad 1                = Zoom to 100%           [modified version only]

Ctrl+O                     = Open file...           [modified version only]
R                          = Reload current file
Q                          = Quit XDot

Escape                     = Cancel current mouse drag action


In addition, the modified version comes with a Find system:

If in incremental Find mode (default):

Ctrl+F                     = Focus the Find field (re-highlighting all matches
                             if the highlight has disappeared)
typing [while in Find]     = Incremental search for the text that is being typed.
                             Highlights all matches.
Escape [while in Find]     = Clear the Find field and exit Find
Return [while in Find]     = Jump to first match
N                          = Jump to next match
Shift+N                    = Jump to previous match

If in non-incremental Find mode (using "-N" command line option):

Ctrl+F                     = Focus the Find field (re-highlighting all matches
                             if the highlight has disappeared)
Escape [while in Find]     = Clear the Find field and exit Find
Return [while in Find]     = Run the search for the current term
                             and highlight all matches.
N                          = First press:     jump to first match
                             Further presses: jump to next match
Shift+N                    = Jump to previous match

(Note that even current Linux distributions may ship a version which does not have the -n (no filter) option.)


===============================================================================
  analyze.sh
===============================================================================

The included analyze.sh is original. It is intended as a rudimentary wrapper for the pyan-fdp-xdot toolchain. The separate fdp step is useful, if one wants to quickly visualize the same data again (since xdot doesn't have to re-generate the layout).


===============================================================================
  gtkcolors
===============================================================================

The included gtkcolors.py is an unmodified copy of the original by Thomas Da, mirrored from:
